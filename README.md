# weka_extensions
Extending Weka's features for essential data mining tasks

PRE-WORDS: 

This repo is aiming to fill the gaps in pre-processing in Weka mining tool. By making various mining techniques, discovered that Weka is not flexible (or at least not easy to find required API) to make required basic techniques, like removing part of the text, counting appearance of value(/s) in text, image comparison into attribute (as nominal) and more. 

IMPLEMENTATION:

The software was downloaded in official Waikato University Website <http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html>. Then weka-src.jar was unpacked and installed for using with Eclipse. For complete installation details, please refer to: <http://weka.wikispaces.com/Eclipse>. 

HOW TO USE REPO:

All the implementation, once pulled from the repo will be available within runtime of Eclipse (or any other IDE) on GUIChooser.java.
